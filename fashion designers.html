    <header><b>The Two Most Famous French Fashion Designers</b></header>
    <article>
        <h1 id = "christian dior"><b>Christian Dior</b></h1>
        <p>Christian Ernest Dior (French: [kʁistjɑ̃ djɔʁ]; 21 January 1905 – 24 October 1957) was a French fashion
            designer and founder of one of the world's top fashion houses, Christian Dior SE. His fashion house is known
            all around the world, having gained prominence "on five continents in only a decade."</p>
        <p> Dior's skills led to his employment and design for various fashion icons in attempts to preserve the fashion
            industry during World War II. After the war, he founded and established the Dior fashion house, with his
            collection of the "New Look". In 1947, the collection debuted featuring rounded shoulders, a cinched waist,
            and very full skirt. The New Look celebrated ultra-femininity and opulence in women's fashion.</p>
        <p>Throughout his lifetime, and after his death, he won numerous awards for Best Costume Design. He died in
            1957. </p>

        <h2 id = "early life dior"><b>Early life</b></h2>
        <p>Dior was born in Granville, a seaside town on the coast of Normandy, France. He was the second of five
            children born to Maurice Dior, a wealthy fertilizer manufacturer (the family firm was Dior Frères), and his
            wife, formerly Madeleine Martin. He had four siblings: Raymond (father of Françoise Dior), Jacqueline,
            Bernard, and Catherine Dior. When Christian was about five years old, the family moved to Paris.</p>
        <p>Dior's family had hoped he would become a diplomat, but Dior was interested in art. To make money, he
            sold his fashion sketches outside his house for about 10 cents each (US$2 in 2024 dollars). In 1928,
            he left school and received money from his father to finance a small art gallery, where he and a friend
            sold art by the likes of Pablo Picasso. Alongside managing his art gallery, Dior cultivated friendships
            with influential artists, including Picasso, Salvador Dalí, Jean Cocteau, and Alberto Giacometti. Immersed
            in this creative environment, Dior drew inspiration from their work, which shaped his later approach in
            fashion design. The gallery closed three years later, following the deaths of Dior's mother and brother,
            as well as financial trouble during the Great Depression that resulted in his father losing control of the
            family business. Dior had no choice but to find another source of income.</p>
        <p>In search of work, Dior again created and sold fashion sketches. Those sketches were discovered by fashion
            designer Robert Piguet. From 1937, Dior was employed by Piguet, who gave him the opportunity to design
            for three collections. Dior later said that "Robert Piguet taught me the virtues of simplicity
            through which true elegance must come." One of his original designs for Piguet, a day dress with a
            short, full skirt that was in his collection called "Cafe Anglais", was particularly well received.
            Whilst working for Piguet, Dior worked alongside Pierre Balmain, and was succeeded as house designer by
            Marc Bohan – who would, in 1960, become head of design for Christian Dior Paris. Dior left Piguet when he
            was called up for military service.</p>
        <p>In 1942, when Dior left the army, he joined the fashion house of Lucien Lelong, where he and Balmain were
            the primary designers. For the duration of World War II, Dior, as an employee of Lelong, designed dresses
            for the wives of Nazi officers and French collaborators, as did other fashion houses that remained in
            business during the war, including Jean Patou, Jeanne Lanvin, and Nina Ricci. His sister, Catherine
            (1917–2008), a member of the French Resistance, was captured by the Gestapo and sent to the Ravensbrück
            concentration camp, where she was incarcerated until her liberation in May 1945. In 1947, Dior named
            his debut fragrance Miss Dior in tribute to her. The story of Dior’s life during WWII and the
            following few years is featured in the mini-series The New Look.</p>
        <p>Dior was known for being superstitious. He often consulted his astrologer before making decisions, and his
            collections frequently featured talismanic symbols. He also carried a cluster of lucky charms with him,
            believing they brought him good fortune. At a pivotal moment when industrialist Marcel Boussac offered
            six million francs to establish Maison Christian Dior, Dior accepted only after receiving approval from two
            separate clairvoyants.
        </p>

        <h2 id = "The Dior fashion House">The Dior fashion House</h2>
        <p>In 1946, Marcel Boussac, a successful entrepreneur, invited Dior to design for Philippe et Gaston, a Paris
            fashion house launched in 1925. Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start under his own name rather
            than reviving an old brand. In 1946, with Boussac's backing, Dior founded his fashion house, ensuring
            exclusive control over the company and securing a third of all profits in addition to his salary. The
            name of the line of his first collection, presented on 12 February 1947, was Corolle (literally the
            botanical term corolla or circlet of flower petals in English). Dior's debut collection included a launch
            of 90 garments displayed in outfits. The phrase New Look was coined for it by Carmel Snow, the
            editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar.</p>
        <p>Dior's designs were more voluptuous than the boxy, fabric-conserving shapes of the recent World War II
            styles that had been influenced by the wartime rationing of fabric. Despite being called "New," the
            Corolle line was clearly drawn from styles of the Edwardian era, refining and crystallizing
            trends in skirt shape and waistline that had been burgeoning in high fashion since the late 1930s.
            The house employed Pierre Cardin as head of its tailoring atelier for the first three years of its
            existence, and it was Cardin who designed one of the most popular of the Corolle ensembles, the 1947 Bar
            suit. </p>
        <p>The "New Look" revolutionized women's dress, reestablished Paris as the centre of the fashion world after
            World War II, and made Dior a virtual arbiter of fashion for much of the following decade. Dior's collection
            was an inspiration to many women post-war and helped them regain their love for fashion. Dior believed that
            fashion was more than clothing; it was an art form and a continuation of French cultural heritage. He
            described maintaining the tradition of fashion as 'an act of faith,' a way to preserve the mystery and
            beauty that fashion brought to society. Each season featured a newly titled Dior "line," in the manner
            of 1947's "Corolle" line, that would be trumpeted in the fashion press: the Envol and
            Cyclone/Zigzag lines in 1948; the Trompe l'Oeil and Mid-Century lines in 1949; the
            Vertical and Oblique lines in 1950; the Oval and Longue/Princesse lines in
            1951; the Sinueuse and Profilėe lines in 1952; the Tulipe and Vivante/Cupola lines in
            1953; the Muguet/Lily of the Valley line and H-Line in 1954; the A-Line and Y-Line
            in 1955; the Flèche/Arrow/F-Line and Aimant/Magnet line in 1956; and the Libre/Free and
            Fuseau/Spindle lines in 1957, followed by successor Yves Saint Laurent's Trapeze line in 1958.</p>
        <p>Dior's last collections, such as the “Libre” and “Fuseau” lines, marked a shift toward a more fluid, relaxed
            silhouette, distancing from the structured designs of earlier years. These changes reflected Dior's response
            to the era's evolving social dynamics, foreshadowing styles that would become iconic in the late 1950s and
            1960s.</p>
        <p>In 1955, 19-year-old Yves Saint Laurent became Dior's design assistant. Dior told Saint Laurent's mother in
            1957 that he had chosen Saint Laurent to succeed him at Dior. She indicated later that she was confused by
            the remark, as Dior was only 52 at the time, but he died later that year.</p>

        <h2 id = "Death dior">Death</h2>
        <p>Dior died of a third heart attack while on vacation in Montecatini, Italy, on 24 October 1957 in the late
        afternoon while playing a game of cards. He was survived by Jacques Benita, a North African singer
        three decades his junior, the last of a number of discreet male lovers.</p>

        <h2 id = "Awards and honors">Awards and honors</h2>
        <p>ior was awarded the French Legion of Honor in 1950. Dior was nominated for the 1955 Academy Award for Best
            Costume Design in black and white for the Terminal Station directed by Vittorio De Sica (1953). The design
            house of Christian Dior, represented by designer Yves St. Laurent,[citation needed] was nominated in 1967
            for a BAFTA for Best British Costume (Colour) for Arabesque directed by Stanley Donen (1966). For the
            11th César Awards in 1986, Dior, represented by Marc Bohan who created costumes from Christian Dior's
            original designs,[citation needed] was nominated for Best Costume Design (Meilleurs costumes) for the 1985
            film Bras de fer.</p>

        <h1 id = "Coco Chanel">Coco Chanel</h1>
        <p>Gabrielle Bonheur "Coco" Chanel (/ʃəˈnɛl/ shə-NEL; French: [ɡabʁijɛl bɔnœʁ kɔko ʃanɛl]; 19 August 1883 – 10
        January 1971) was a French fashion designer and businesswoman. The founder and namesake of the Chanel brand,
        she was credited in the post–World War I era with popularising a sporty, casual chic as the feminine standard
        of style. She is the only fashion designer listed on Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people of
        the 20th century. A prolific fashion creator, Chanel extended her influence beyond couture clothing into
        jewellery, handbags, and fragrance. Her signature scent, Chanel No. 5, has become an iconic product, and Chanel
            herself designed her famed interlocked-CC monogram, which has been in use since the 1920s.</p>
        <p>Her couture house closed in 1939, with the outbreak of World War II. Chanel stayed in France during the Nazi
            German occupation and collaborated with the occupiers and the Vichy puppet regime. Declassified documents
            revealed that she had collaborated directly with the Nazi intelligence service, the Sicherheitsdienst. One
            plan in late 1943 was for her to carry an SS peace overture to Churchill to end the war. Chanel began a
            liaison with a German diplomat/spy she had known before the war, Baron (Freiherr) Hans Günther von
            Dincklage. After the end of the war, Chanel was interrogated about her relationship with Dincklage, but she
            was not charged as a collaborator due to intervention by her friend—British prime minister Winston
            Churchill. When the war ended, Chanel moved to Switzerland before returning to Paris in 1954 to revive her
            fashion house.</p>

        <h2 id = "early life chanel"><b>Early life</b></h2>
        <p>Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel was born in 1883 to Eugénie Jeanne Devolle Chanel, known as Jeanne, a laundrywoman, in
        the charity hospital run by the Sisters of Providence (a poorhouse) in Saumur, Maine-et-Loire.
        She was Jeanne's second child with Albert Chanel; the first, Julia, had been born less than a year earlier.
        Albert Chanel was an itinerant street vendor who peddled work clothes and undergarments, living a
        nomadic life, travelling to and from market towns. The family resided in run-down lodgings. In 1884, he married
        Jeanne Devolle, persuaded to legitimate his children by her family who had "united, effectively, to pay Albert".
        </p>
        <p>At birth, Chanel's name was entered into the official registry as "Chasnel". Jeanne was too unwell to attend the
        registration, and Albert was registered as "traveling".</p>
        <p>She went to her grave as Gabrielle Chasnel because to correct, legally, the misspelled name on her birth
        certificate would reveal that she was born in a poor house hospice. The couple had six children—Julia,
        Gabrielle, Alphonse (the first boy, born 1885), Antoinette (born 1887), Lucien, and Augustin (who died at six
        months)—and lived crowded into a one-room lodging in the town of Brive-la-Gaillarde.</p>
        <p>When Gabrielle was 11, Jeanne died at the age of 32. The children did not attend school.
        Her father sent his two sons to work as farm labourers and sent his three daughters to the convent of
        Aubazine, which ran an orphanage. Its religious order, the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Mary, was
        "founded to care for the poor and rejected, including running homes for abandoned and orphaned girls".
        It was a stark, frugal life, demanding strict discipline. Placement in the orphanage may have contributed to
        Chanel's future career, as it was where she learned to sew. At age eighteen, Chanel, too old to remain at
            Aubazine, went to live in a boarding house for Catholic girls in the town of Moulins.</p>
        <p>Later in life, Chanel would retell the story of her childhood somewhat differently; she would often include
            more glamorous accounts, which were generally untrue. She said that when her mother died, her father
            sailed for America to seek his fortune, and she was sent to live with two aunts. She also claimed to have
            been born a decade later than 1883 and that her mother had died when she was much younger than 11.</p>

        <h3>Aspirations for a stage career</h3>
        <p>Having learned to sew during her six years at Aubazine, Chanel found employment as a seamstress. When
            not sewing, she sang in a cabaret frequented by cavalry officers. Chanel made her stage debut singing at a
            cafe-concert (a popular entertainment venue of the era) in a Moulins pavilion, La Rotonde. She was a
            poseuse, a performer who entertained the crowd between star turns. The money earned was what they managed
            to accumulate when the plate was passed. It was at this time that Gabrielle acquired the name "Coco" when
            she spent her nights singing in the cabaret, often the song, "Who Has Seen Coco?" She often liked to say
            the nickname was given to her by her father. Others believe "Coco" came from Ko Ko Ri Ko, and Qui qu'a
            vu Coco, or it was an allusion to the French word for kept woman, cocotte. As an entertainer, Chanel
            radiated a juvenile allure that tantalised the military habitués of the cabaret.</p>
        <p>In 1906, Chanel worked in the spa resort town of Vichy. Vichy boasted a profusion of concert halls, theatres,
            and cafés where she hoped to achieve success as a performer. Chanel's youth and physical charms impressed
            those for whom she auditioned, but her singing voice was marginal and she failed to find stage work.
            Obliged to find employment, she took work at the Grande Grille, where as a donneuse d'eau she was one whose
            job was to dispense glasses of the purportedly curative mineral water for which Vichy was renowned.
            When the Vichy season ended, Chanel returned to Moulins, and her former haunt La Rotonde. She realised then
            that a serious stage career was not in her future.</p>

        <h3>Balsan and Capel</h3>
        <p>At Moulins, Chanel met a young French ex-cavalry officer and textile heir, Étienne Balsan. At the age of
            twenty-three, Chanel became Balsan's mistress, supplanting the courtesan Émilienne d'Alençon as his new
            favourite. For the next three years, she lived with him in his château Royallieu near Compiègne, an area
            known for its wooded equestrian paths and the hunting life. It was a lifestyle of self-indulgence. Balsan's
            wealth allowed the cultivation of a social set that revelled in partying and the gratification of human
            appetites, with all the implied accompanying decadence. Balsan showered Chanel with the baubles of
            "the rich life"—diamonds, dresses, and pearls. Biographer Justine Picardie, in her 2010 study Coco Chanel:
            The Legend and the Life, suggests that the fashion designer's nephew, André Palasse, supposedly the only
            child of her sister Julia-Berthe who had committed suicide, was Chanel's child by Balsan</p>
        <p>In 1908, Chanel began an affair with one of Balsan's friends, Captain Arthur Edward 'Boy' Capel.[21] In
            later years, Chanel reminisced of this time in her life: "two gentlemen were outbidding for my hot little
            body." Capel, a wealthy member of the English upper class, installed Chanel in an apartment
            in Paris, and financed her first shops. It is said that Capel's sartorial style influenced the
            conception of the Chanel look. The bottle design for Chanel No. 5 had two probable origins, both
            attributable to her association with Capel. It is believed Chanel adapted the rectangular, bevelled lines
            of the Charvet toiletry bottles he carried in his leather travelling case or she adapted the design of
            the whisky decanter Capel used. She so much admired it that she wished to reproduce it in "exquisite,
            expensive, delicate glass". The couple spent time together at fashionable resorts such as
            Deauville, but despite Chanel's hopes that they would settle together, Capel was never faithful to her.
            Their affair lasted nine years. Even after Capel married an English aristocrat, Lady Diana Wyndham in 1918,
            he did not completely break off with Chanel. He died in a car accident on 22 December 1919. A
            roadside memorial at the site of Capel's accident is said to have been commissioned by Chanel.
            Twenty-five years after the event, Chanel, then residing in Switzerland, confided to her friend, Paul
            Morand, "His death was a terrible blow to me. In losing Capel, I lost everything. What followed was not a
            life of happiness, I have to say."</p>
        <p>Chanel had begun designing hats while living with Balsan, initially as a diversion that evolved into a
            commercial enterprise. She became a licensed milliner in 1910 and opened a boutique at 21 rue Cambon, Paris,
            named Chanel Modes. As this location already housed an established clothing business, Chanel sold only
            her millinery creations at this address. Chanel's millinery career bloomed once theatre actress Gabrielle
            Dorziat wore her hats in Fernand Nozière's play Bel Ami in 1912. Subsequently, Dorziat modelled Chanel's
            hats again in photographs published in Les Modes.</p>

        <h3>Deauville and Biarritz</h3>
        <p>In 1913, Chanel opened a boutique in Deauville, financed by Arthur Capel, where she introduced deluxe casual
            clothing suitable for leisure and sport. The fashions were constructed from humble fabrics such as jersey
            and tricot, at the time primarily used for men's underwear. The location was a prime one, in the center
            of town on a fashionable street. Here Chanel sold hats, jackets, sweaters, and the marinière, the sailor
            blouse. Chanel had the dedicated support of two family members, her sister Antoinette, and her paternal
            aunt Adrienne, who was of a similar age. Adrienne and Antoinette were recruited to model
            Chanel's designs; on a daily basis the two women paraded through the town and on its boardwalks,
            advertising the Chanel creations.</p>
        <p>Chanel, determined to re-create the success she enjoyed in Deauville, opened an establishment in Biarritz in
            1915. Biarritz, on the Côte Basque, close to wealthy Spanish clients, was a playground for the moneyed set
            and those exiled from their native countries by the war. The Biarritz shop was installed not as a
            store-front, but in a villa opposite the casino. After one year of operation, the business proved to be so
            lucrative that in 1916 Chanel was able to reimburse Capel's original investment. In
            Biarritz Chanel met an expatriate aristocrat, the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia. They had a
            romantic interlude, and maintained a close association for many years afterward. By 1919,
            Chanel was registered as a couturière and established her maison de couture at 31 rue Cambon, Paris.</p>
