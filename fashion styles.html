            <p id = "overview haute couture">Haute couture is the creation of exclusive custom-fitted high-end fashion design. The term haute
                couture generally refers to a specific type of upper garment common in Europe during the 16th to the
                18th century, or to the upper portion of a modern dress to distinguish it from the skirt and sleeves.
                Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, Paris became the centre of a growing industry that focused on
                making outfits from high-quality, expensive, often unusual fabric and sewn with extreme attention to
                detail and finished by the most experienced and capable of sewers—often using time-consuming,
                hand-executed techniques.</p>

            <p id ="history_p">The term haute couture is protected by French law and defined by the Paris Chamber of Commerce.
            The Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode is defined as "the regulating commission that
            determines which fashion houses are eligible to be true haute couture houses". Their rules state that
            only "those companies mentioned on the list drawn up each year by a commission domiciled at the Ministry
            for Industry are entitled to avail themselves" of the label haute couture. The Chambre Syndicale de
            la Couture Parisienne is an association of Parisian couturiers founded in 1868 as an outgrowth of
            medieval guilds that regulate its members with regard to counterfeiting of styles, dates of openings
            for collections, number of models presented, relations with press, questions of law and taxes, and
            promotional activities.</p>
            <p id ="history_rest">Formation of the organisation was brought about by Charles Frederick Worth.
            An affiliated school was organized in 1930 called L'Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture. The
            school helps bring new designers to help the "couture" houses that are still present today. Since 1975,
            it has operated within the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode.</p>
