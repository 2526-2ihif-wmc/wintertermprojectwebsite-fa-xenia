            <p id = "overview haute couture"><b>H</b>aute couture is the creation of exclusive custom-fitted high-end fashion design. The term haute
                couture generally refers to a specific type of upper garment common in Europe during the 16th to the
                18th century, or to the upper portion of a modern dress to distinguish it from the skirt and sleeves.
                Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, Paris became the centre of a growing industry that focused on
                making outfits from high-quality, expensive, often unusual fabric and sewn with extreme attention to
                detail and finished by the most experienced and capable of sewers—often using time-consuming,
                hand-executed techniques.</p>

            <p id ="history_haute"><b>T</b>he term haute couture is protected by French law and defined by the Paris Chamber of Commerce.
                The Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode is defined as "the regulating commission that
                determines which fashion houses are eligible to be true haute couture houses". Their rules state that
                only "those companies mentioned on the list drawn up each year by a commission domiciled at the Ministry
                for Industry are entitled to avail themselves" of the label haute couture. The Chambre Syndicale de
                la Couture Parisienne is an association of Parisian couturiers founded in 1868 as an outgrowth of
                medieval guilds that regulate its members with regard to counterfeiting of styles, dates of openings
                for collections, number of models presented, relations with press, questions of law and taxes, and
                promotional activities.</p>
            <p id ="history_haute_rest">Formation of the organisation was brought about by Charles Frederick Worth.
                An affiliated school was organized in 1930 called L'Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture. The
                school helps bring new designers to help the "couture" houses that are still present today. Since 1975,
                it has operated within the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode.</p>

            <p id="rococo_part1"><b>R</b>ococo fashion was based on extravagance, elegance, refinement and decoration.
                Women's fashion of the seventeenth-century was contrasted by the fashion of the eighteenth-century,
                which was ornate and sophisticated, the true style of Rococo. These fashions spread beyond the
                royal court into the salons and cafés of the ascendant bourgeoisie. The exuberant, playful, elegant
                style of decoration and design that we now call 'Rococo' was then known as le style rocaille, le style
                moderne, le gout.</p>
            <img src="a19eb11817aa2329a466a0725285e4e3.jpg" alt="rococo blue dress" id="blue_dress_portrait"/>
            <p id="rococo_part2">A style that appeared in the early eighteenth-century was the robe volante, a
                flowing gown, that became popular towards the end of King Louis XIV's reign. This gown had the features
                of a bodice with large pleats flowing down the back to the ground over a rounded petticoat. The colour
                palette was rich, dark fabrics accompanied by elaborate, heavy design features. </p>
            <p id="rococo_part2_rest">After the death of Louis XIV the clothing styles began to change. The fashion took a turn to a lighter, more frivolous style,
                transitioning from the baroque period to the well-known style of Rococo. The later period was known
                for their pastel colours, more revealing frocks, and the plethora of frills, ruffles, bows, and lace as
                trims. Shortly after the typical women's Rococo gown was introduced, robe à la Française, a gown
                with a tight bodice that had a low cut neckline, usually with a large ribbon bows down the centre front,
                wide panniers, and was lavishly trimmed in large amounts of lace, ribbon, and flowers. </p>
            <p id ="rococo_part3">The Watteau pleats also became more popular, named after the painter Jean-Antoine Watteau, who
                painted the details of the gowns down to the stitches of lace and other trimmings with immense accuracy.
                Later, the 'pannier' and 'mantua' became fashionable around 1718. They were wide hoops under the dress
                to extend the hips out sideways and they soon became a staple in formal wear. This gave the Rococo
                period the iconic dress of wide hips combined with the large amount of decoration on the garments. Wide
                panniers were worn for special occasions, and could reach up to 16 feet (4.9 metres) in diameter, and
                smaller hoops were worn for the everyday settings. These features originally came from
                seventeenth-century Spanish fashion, known as guardainfante, initially designed to hide the pregnant
                stomach, then reimagined later as the pannier. 1745 became the Golden Age of the Rococo with the
                introduction of a more exotic, oriental culture in France called a la turque. This was made popular
                by Louis XV's mistress, Madame de Pompadour, who commissioned the artist, Charles-André van Loo, to
                paint her as a Turkish sultana. </p>
            <img src="Fashion at Versailles _ Château de Versailles.jpeg" alt="fashion at Versailles" id="fashionatversailles">
            <p id="rococo_part4">In the 1760s, a style of less formal dresses emerged and one of these was the polonaise, with inspiration
                taken from Poland. It was shorter than the French dress, allowing the underskirt and ankles to be seen,
                which made it easier to move around in. Another dress that came into fashion was the robe a l'anglais,
                which included elements inspired by the males' fashion; a short jacket, broad lapels and long sleeves.
                It also had a snug bodice, a full skirt without panniers but still a little long in the back to form a
                small train, and often some type of lace kerchief worn around the neck. Another piece was the
                'redingote', halfway between a cape and an overcoat. </p>
            <p id="rococo_part5">Accessories were also important to all women during this time, as they added to the opulence and the
                decor of the body to match their gowns. At any official ceremony ladies were required to cover their
                hands and arms with gloves if their clothes were sleeveless.</p>

            <p class="overview_empire">
                <b>E</b>mpire silhouette, Empire line, Empire waist or just Empire is a style in clothing
                in which the dress has a fitted bodice ending just below the bust, giving a high-waisted appearance, and
                a gathered skirt which is long and loosely fitting but skims the body rather than being supported by
                voluminous petticoats.<p>

            <p class="overview_empire">
            While the style goes back to the late 18th century, the term "Empire silhouette" arose over a century
                later in early 20th-century Britain; here the word empire refers to the period of the First French
                Empire (1804–1815); Napoleon's first Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais was influential in popularizing
                the style around Europe. The word "empire" is pronounced with a special quasi-French pronunciation
                /ɑːmˈpɪər/ in the fashion world.</p>
            <img src="dbeb937b4afdc1e253603fec5331784e.jpg" alt="La Soiree after Painting by Vittorio Reggianini" id="LaSoiree">
            <div class ="black_stripe"></div>
            <p class="history_empire" id="history_empire1"><b>T</b>he style began as part of Neoclassical fashion, reviving styles from Greco-Roman art which showed women wearing loose fitting rectangular tunics, known as peplos or the more common chiton, which were belted under the bust, providing support and a cool, comfortable outfit suitable for the warm climate. </p>
            <p class="history_empire" id="history_empire2">The last few years of the 18th century first saw the style coming into fashion in Western and Central Europe (and European-influenced areas). In 1788, just before the Revolution, the court portraitist Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun had held a "Greek supper" where the ladies wore plain white "Greek" tunics. Shorter classical hairstyles, where possible with curls, were less controversial and very widely adopted. Hair was now uncovered even outdoors; except for evening dress, bonnets or other coverings had typically been worn even indoors before. Thin Greek-style ribbons or fillets were used to tie or decorate the hair instead. </p>
            <p class="history_empire" id="history_empire3">Empire dresses were light and loose, usually white, and were often made with short sleeves. A tie around the waistline, sitting just below the bust, was often in a different color. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often red with a decorative border in portraits, was also worn, and was lain around the midriff when seated—for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favored. By the turn of the 19th century, such styles had spread widely across Europe. In France the style was sometimes called "à la grecque" after the decorations found on the pottery and sculpture of Classical Greek art, though the empire dress had multiple sources, including Marie Antoinette's chemise à la reine, a simple white gown influenced by those worn by European women living abroad in warm climates, including the Americas. Napoleon used the dress in an imperial context, shifting its meaning from Greece to Rome in line with his political agenda during the Empire period.</p>
            <p class="history_empire" id="history_empire4">The adoption of this style led to a drastic contrast between 1790s fashions and the constricting and voluminous styles of the 1770s (with a rigid cylindrical torso above panniers). The change is probably partially due to the French political upheavals after 1789 (which encouraged the recovery of ancient virtues, and discouraged the type of ostentatious ornately luxurious display formerly common in aristocratic fashions). The early styles often featured entirely bare arms, as in the ancient exemplars, but from about 1800 short sleeves became more typical, initially sometimes transparent as in David's Portrait of Madame Récamier (1800), then puffed. The style evolved through the Napoleonic era until the early 1820s, becoming gradually less simple, after which the hourglass Victorian styles became more popular. </p>
