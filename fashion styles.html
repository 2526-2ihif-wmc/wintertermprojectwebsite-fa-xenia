            <p id = "overview haute couture">Haute couture is the creation of exclusive custom-fitted high-end fashion design. The term haute
                couture generally refers to a specific type of upper garment common in Europe during the 16th to the
                18th century, or to the upper portion of a modern dress to distinguish it from the skirt and sleeves.
                Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, Paris became the centre of a growing industry that focused on
                making outfits from high-quality, expensive, often unusual fabric and sewn with extreme attention to
                detail and finished by the most experienced and capable of sewers—often using time-consuming,
                hand-executed techniques.</p>

            <p id ="history_p">The term haute couture is protected by French law and defined by the Paris Chamber of Commerce.
            The Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode is defined as "the regulating commission that
            determines which fashion houses are eligible to be true haute couture houses". Their rules state that
            only "those companies mentioned on the list drawn up each year by a commission domiciled at the Ministry
            for Industry are entitled to avail themselves" of the label haute couture. The Chambre Syndicale de
            la Couture Parisienne is an association of Parisian couturiers founded in 1868 as an outgrowth of
            medieval guilds that regulate its members with regard to counterfeiting of styles, dates of openings
            for collections, number of models presented, relations with press, questions of law and taxes, and
            promotional activities.</p>
            <p id ="history_rest">Formation of the organisation was brought about by Charles Frederick Worth.
            An affiliated school was organized in 1930 called L'Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture. The
            school helps bring new designers to help the "couture" houses that are still present today. Since 1975,
            it has operated within the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode.</p>

            <p id="rococo_part1">Rococo fashion was based on extravagance, elegance, refinement and decoration.
                Women's fashion of the seventeenth-century was contrasted by the fashion of the eighteenth-century,
                which was ornate and sophisticated, the true style of Rococo. These fashions spread beyond the
                royal court into the salons and cafés of the ascendant bourgeoisie. The exuberant, playful, elegant
                style of decoration and design that we now call 'Rococo' was then known as le style rocaille, le style
                moderne, le gout.</p>
            <img src="a19eb11817aa2329a466a0725285e4e3.jpg" alt="rococo blue dress" id="blue_dress_portrait"/>
            <p id="rococo_part2">A style that appeared in the early eighteenth-century was the robe volante, a
                flowing gown, that became popular towards the end of King Louis XIV's reign. This gown had the features
                of a bodice with large pleats flowing down the back to the ground over a rounded petticoat. The colour
                palette was rich, dark fabrics accompanied by elaborate, heavy design features. </p>
            <p id="rococo_part2_rest">After the death of Louis XIV the clothing styles began to change. The fashion took a turn to a lighter, more frivolous style,
                transitioning from the baroque period to the well-known style of Rococo. The later period was known
                for their pastel colours, more revealing frocks, and the plethora of frills, ruffles, bows, and lace as
                trims. Shortly after the typical women's Rococo gown was introduced, robe à la Française, a gown
                with a tight bodice that had a low cut neckline, usually with a large ribbon bows down the centre front,
                wide panniers, and was lavishly trimmed in large amounts of lace, ribbon, and flowers. </p>
            <p id ="rococo_part3">The Watteau pleats also became more popular, named after the painter Jean-Antoine Watteau, who
                painted the details of the gowns down to the stitches of lace and other trimmings with immense accuracy.
                Later, the 'pannier' and 'mantua' became fashionable around 1718. They were wide hoops under the dress
                to extend the hips out sideways and they soon became a staple in formal wear. This gave the Rococo
                period the iconic dress of wide hips combined with the large amount of decoration on the garments. Wide
                panniers were worn for special occasions, and could reach up to 16 feet (4.9 metres) in diameter, and
                smaller hoops were worn for the everyday settings. These features originally came from
                seventeenth-century Spanish fashion, known as guardainfante, initially designed to hide the pregnant
                stomach, then reimagined later as the pannier. 1745 became the Golden Age of the Rococo with the
                introduction of a more exotic, oriental culture in France called a la turque. This was made popular
                by Louis XV's mistress, Madame de Pompadour, who commissioned the artist, Charles-André van Loo, to
                paint her as a Turkish sultana. </p>

            <p id="rococo_part4">In the 1760s, a style of less formal dresses emerged and one of these was the polonaise, with inspiration
                taken from Poland. It was shorter than the French dress, allowing the underskirt and ankles to be seen,
                which made it easier to move around in. Another dress that came into fashion was the robe a l'anglais,
                which included elements inspired by the males' fashion; a short jacket, broad lapels and long sleeves.
                It also had a snug bodice, a full skirt without panniers but still a little long in the back to form a
                small train, and often some type of lace kerchief worn around the neck. Another piece was the
                'redingote', halfway between a cape and an overcoat. </p>
            <p id="rococo_part5">Accessories were also important to all women during this time, as they added to the opulence and the
                decor of the body to match their gowns. At any official ceremony ladies were required to cover their
                hands and arms with gloves if their clothes were sleeveless.</p>
