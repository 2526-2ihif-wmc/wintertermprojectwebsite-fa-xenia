    <p>Fashion prints</p>
    <br>
    <p>The association of France with fashion and style (la mode) is widely credited as beginning during the reign of
        Louis XIV[5] when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French
        royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. The rise in prominence of French
        fashion was linked to the creation of the fashion press in the early 1670s (due in large part to Jean Donneau
        de Visé), which transformed the fashion industry by marketing designs to a broad public outside the French
        court and by popularizing notions such as the fashion "season" and changing styles. The prints were usually
        14.25 X 9.5 and depicted a man or woman of quality wearing the latest fashions. They were usually shown head
        to toe, but with no individuality or defined facial features. Sometimes the figure would be depicted from
        behind in order to showcase a different side of the clothing. Although the individual in the prints
        was often crudely sketched, the garment itself was impeccably drawn and detailed. Accessories to the garment
        also received nuanced attention.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Louis XIV, although later hailed as a patron of fashion, did not actually have a large role in its spread and
        proliferation—which was due to the fashion prints. The fashion prints were ubiquitous, but Louis XIV neither
        sponsored nor hindered their production and proliferation, and largely stayed out of it unless the prints of
        himself specifically were treasonous, satirical, or caricatures.
        Fashion in royal portraits</p>
    <p>Throughout his lifetime, Louis XIV commissioned numerous works of art to portray himself, among them over
        300 formal portraits. The earliest portrayals of Louis already followed the pictorial conventions of the
        day in depicting the child king as the majestically royal incarnation of France. This idealisation persisted
        in subsequent works, which deliberately omitted the effects of the smallpox Louis contracted in 1647.
        In the 1660s, representations of Louis evolved to depict him as a Roman emperor, the god Apollo, or Alexander
        the Great, as can be seen in many works of Charles Le Brun, such as sculpture, paintings, and the decor of
        major monuments. The depiction of the King in this manner focused on allegorical or mythological attributes,
        instead of attempting to produce a true likeness. As Louis aged, so too did the manner in which he was depicted.
        Nonetheless, there was still a disparity between realistic representation and the demands of royal propaganda.
        There is no better illustration of this than in Hyacinthe Rigaud's frequently-reproduced Portrait of Louis XIV
        of 1701, in which a 63-year-old Louis appears to stand on a set of unnaturally young legs. In 1680,
        Louis began to be portrayed directly rather than in a mythological setting. This began the "fashion portraits",
        which were prints that depicted the King wearing the notable fashions of the season. These prints
        were also largely unofficial, which meant printers were unaffiliated with the Crown. They largely went
        unchallenged by authorities, however, as long as they portrayed the King in a positive light. Those who did
        portray the King satirically or with the use of caricature faced imprisonment.</p>

    <p>Rigaud's portrait exemplified the height of royal portraiture in Louis's reign. Although Rigaud crafted a
        credible likeness of Louis, the portrait was neither meant as an exercise in realism nor to explore Louis's
        personal character. Certainly, Rigaud was concerned with detail and depicted the King's costume with great
        precision, down to his shoe buckle.[12] However, Rigaud's intention was to glorify the monarchy. Rigaud's
        original, now housed in the Louvre, was originally meant as a gift to Louis's grandson, Philip V of Spain.
        However, Louis was so pleased with the work that he kept the original and commissioned a copy to be sent to
        his grandson. That became the first of many copies, both in full and half-length formats, to be made by Rigaud,
        often with the help of his assistants. The portrait also became a model for French royal and imperial
        portraiture down to the time of Charles X over a century later. In his work, Rigaud proclaims Louis's
        exalted royal status through his elegant stance and haughty expression, the royal regalia and throne, rich
        ceremonial fleur-de-lys robes, as well as the upright column in the background, which, together with the
        draperies, serves to frame this image of majesty.</p>
