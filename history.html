    <p>The association of France with fashion and style (la mode) is widely credited as beginning during the reign of
        Louis XIV when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French
        royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. The rise in prominence of French
        fashion was linked to the creation of the fashion press in the early 1670s (due in large part to Jean Donneau
        de Visé), which transformed the fashion industry by marketing designs to a broad public outside the French
        court and by popularizing notions such as the fashion "season" and changing styles. The prints were usually
        14.25 X 9.5 and depicted a man or woman of quality wearing the latest fashions. They were usually shown head
        to toe, but with no individuality or defined facial features. Sometimes the figure would be depicted from
        behind in order to showcase a different side of the clothing. Although the individual in the prints
        was often crudely sketched, the garment itself was impeccably drawn and detailed. Accessories to the garment
        also received nuanced attention.</p>

    <p>Louis XIV, although later hailed as a patron of fashion, did not actually have a large role in its spread and
        proliferation—which was due to the fashion prints. The fashion prints were ubiquitous, but Louis XIV neither
        sponsored nor hindered their production and proliferation, and largely stayed out of it unless the prints of
        himself specifically were treasonous, satirical, or caricatures.</p>

    <p class = "subheadings">Fashion in royal portraits</p>
    <p>Throughout his lifetime, Louis XIV commissioned numerous works of art to portray himself, among them over
        300 formal portraits. The earliest portrayals of Louis already followed the pictorial conventions of the
        day in depicting the child king as the majestically royal incarnation of France. This idealisation persisted
        in subsequent works, which deliberately omitted the effects of the smallpox Louis contracted in 1647.
        In the 1660s, representations of Louis evolved to depict him as a Roman emperor, the god Apollo, or Alexander
        the Great, as can be seen in many works of Charles Le Brun, such as sculpture, paintings, and the decor of
        major monuments. The depiction of the King in this manner focused on allegorical or mythological attributes,
        instead of attempting to produce a true likeness. As Louis aged, so too did the manner in which he was depicted.
        Nonetheless, there was still a disparity between realistic representation and the demands of royal propaganda.
        There is no better illustration of this than in Hyacinthe Rigaud's frequently-reproduced Portrait of Louis XIV
        of 1701, in which a 63-year-old Louis appears to stand on a set of unnaturally young legs. In 1680,
        Louis began to be portrayed directly rather than in a mythological setting. This began the "fashion portraits",
        which were prints that depicted the King wearing the notable fashions of the season. These prints
        were also largely unofficial, which meant printers were unaffiliated with the Crown. They largely went
        unchallenged by authorities, however, as long as they portrayed the King in a positive light. Those who did
        portray the King satirically or with the use of caricature faced imprisonment.</p>
    <p>Rigaud's portrait exemplified the height of royal portraiture in Louis's reign. Although Rigaud crafted a
        credible likeness of Louis, the portrait was neither meant as an exercise in realism nor to explore Louis's
        personal character. Certainly, Rigaud was concerned with detail and depicted the King's costume with great
        precision, down to his shoe buckle. However, Rigaud's intention was to glorify the monarchy. Rigaud's
        original, now housed in the Louvre, was originally meant as a gift to Louis's grandson, Philip V of Spain.
        However, Louis was so pleased with the work that he kept the original and commissioned a copy to be sent to
        his grandson. That became the first of many copies, both in full and half-length formats, to be made by Rigaud,
        often with the help of his assistants. The portrait also became a model for French royal and imperial
        portraiture down to the time of Charles X over a century later. In his work, Rigaud proclaims Louis's
        exalted royal status through his elegant stance and haughty expression, the royal regalia and throne, rich
        ceremonial fleur-de-lys robes, as well as the upright column in the background, which, together with the
        draperies, serves to frame this image of majesty.</p>
    <p class = "subheadings">Trends</p>
    <p>
        Louis XIV notably introduced one of the most noticeable feature of the men's costume of the time: immense
        wigs of curled hair. A commonly held belief is that Louis XIV started to wear wigs due to balding,
        and to imitate this his courtiers put on false hair. The wearing of wigs lasted for over a century;
        they went through many changes, but they were never quite so exaggerated as during this period.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite the rise of la mode during Louis XIV's reign, many of the clothes he wore did not survive or were
        taken from the monarchy's possession. Much like the Crown Jewels, a French king did not actually own any of
        his clothes. They belonged to the Garde-robe du roi (King's Wardrobe), which dated back to the 16th century.
        Due to Louis XIV's changes to the King's Wardrobe, officers had a right to the clothes once the monarch died,
        as long as they would not be used by the king's successor. Furthermore, although the Louis XIV's formal
        clothing would change along with the rest of la mode, his ceremonial clothing did not, and remained with
        tradition. The king also used fashion to create a certain effect or theme. During the marriage of his
        great-grandson Louis, Duke of Burgundy to Princess Marie Adélaïde, the French entourage dressed in bright
        colors and fashions to contrast with the more soberly dressed Spanish. This was in order to seem younger
        and more virile than the Spanish courtiers.

    <p>The extravagant styles of the French Royal court racked up enormous debts to keep up its pace, at the peasants'
        expense. Such fashion sprees notably ruined Marie Antoinette's reputation, and were one of the many factors
        paving the way for the French Revolution.</p>
    <p>Long after her death, Marie Antoinette remains a major historical figure linked with conservative and the
        Catholic Church positions; and a major cultural icon associated with high glamour, wealth and a certain
        style of life based on luxury and celebrity appealing today to the social and cultural elites; frequently
        referenced in popular culture, being the subject of several books, films and other forms of media. Most
        academics and scholars, have deemed her the quintessential representative of class conflict, western
        aristocracy and absolutism government in addition to being frivolous, superficial; and have attributed the
        start of the French Revolution.</p>
    <p>The phrase "Let them eat cake" is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, but there is no evidence she ever
        uttered it, and it is now generally regarded as a "journalistic cliché". It may have been a rumor
        started by angry French peasants as a form of libel. This phrase originally appeared in Book VI of the first
        part (finished in 1767, published in 1782) of Rousseau's putative autobiographical work, Les Confessions:
        "Enfin je me rappelai le pis-aller d'une grande princesse à qui l'on disait que les paysans n'avaient pas de
        pain, et qui répondit: Qu'ils mangent de la brioche" ("Finally I recalled the stopgap solution of a great
        princess who was told that the peasants had no bread, and who responded: 'Let them eat brioche'"). Apart from
        the fact that Rousseau ascribes these words to an unknown princess, vaguely referred to as a "great princess",
        some think that he invented it altogether as Confessions was largely inaccurate.</p>
    <p>In 1700, the total monetary value of goods produced in France was documented at a rate of 5%. By the 1780s,
        gross domestic product rates had increased to 13%. The escalation in production was largely attributable
        to the growth of the textile industry. The boom in consumerism was fueled by an overwhelming interest in high
        fashion which surpassed the boundaries of economic rank. French plebeian's wardrobes became increasingly
        valuable. Particularly in Paris, women began purchasing dupes of luxury items customarily worn by the elite.
        These fashion accessories included watches, buttons, and belt buckles.</p>
    <p>The rise in distinguishable fashion styles worn by lower class French citizens was exhibited by the coordination
        of patriotic clothing worn by the republican Sans-culottes. The Sans-culottes were the working class of French
        peasants who fought for liberty during the French Revolution (1789–1799). The Sans-culottes (lit. "without
        knee-breeches") rejected the powdered wigs and the knee-breeches assimilated to the nobility, and instead
        favored informal styles (full-length trousers, and natural hair), which finally triumphed over the brocades,
        lace, periwig, and powder of the earlier eighteenth century.</p>
    <p>Fashion during the French Revolution greatly reflected the political climate of France. Sans-culottes were known
        to wear the red cap of liberty, also called the Phrygian cap. This cap was a controversial symbol of rebellion
        worn exclusively by lower class revolutionaries. Furthermore, the official French colors of blue, red, and
        white (chosen to be the recognizable patriotic colors of the revolution in 1789), came together to form the
        tricolor cockade. The design of the tricolor cockade often appeared in dresses, fans, and pins of French
        citizens who were in support of the French Revolution. Patriotic women were often clad in a dark uniform of
        black skirts, jackets, and hats adorned with a tricolor cockade.</p>

    <p>
        After the fall of the Jacobins and their Sans-culottes supporters, the supporters of the Thermidorian Reaction
        were known as the Incroyables and Merveilleuses. They scandalized Paris with their extravagant clothes.
        The Merveilleuses wore dresses and tunics modeled after the ancient Greeks and Romans, cut of light or even
        transparent linen and gauze. Sometimes so revealing they were termed "woven air", many gowns displayed cleavage
        and were too tight to allow pockets. To carry even a handkerchief, the ladies had to use small bags known as
        reticules. They were fond of wigs, often choosing blonde because the Paris Commune had banned blonde wigs,
        but they also wore them in black, blue, and green. Enormous hats, short curls like those on Roman busts, and
        Greek-style sandals were the most popular. The sandals were tied above the ankle with crossed ribbons or
        strings of pearls. Exotic and expensive scents fabricated by perfume houses like Parfums Lubin were worn as
        both for style and as indicators of social station. Thérésa Tallien, known as "Our Lady of Thermidor", wore
        expensive rings on the toes of her bare feet and gold circlets on her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Incroyables wore eccentric outfits: large earrings, green jackets, wide trousers, huge neckties, thick
        glasses, and hats topped by "dog ears", their hair falling on their ears. Their musk-based fragrances earned
        them too the derogatory nickname muscadins among the lower classes, already applied to a wide group of
        anti-Jacobins. They wore bicorne hats and carried bludgeons, which they referred to as their "executive power."
        Hair was often shoulder-length, sometimes pulled up in the back with a comb to imitate the hairstyles of the
        condemned. Some sported large monocles, and they frequently affected a lisp and sometimes a stooped hunchbacked
        posture.
    </p>
    <p>In addition to Madame Tallien, famous Merveilleuses included Anne Françoise Elizabeth Lange, Jeanne Françoise
        Julie Adélaïde Récamier, and two very popular Créoles: Fortunée Hamelin and Hortense de Beauharnais. Hortense,
        a daughter of the Empress Josephine, married Louis Bonaparte and became the mother of Napoleon III. Fortunée
        was not born rich, but she became famous for her salons and her string of prominent lovers. Parisian society
        compared Germaine de Staël and Mme Raguet to Minerva and Juno and named their garments for Roman deities:
        gowns were styled Flora or Diana, and tunics were styled à la Ceres or Minerva.</p>
    <p>The leading Incroyable, Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras, was one of five Directors who ran the
        Republic of France and gave the period its name. He hosted luxurious feasts attended by royalists, repentant
        Jacobins, ladies, and courtesans. Since divorce was now legal, sexuality was looser than in the past. However,
        de Barras' reputation for immorality may have been a factor in his later overthrow, a coup that brought the
        French Consulate to power and paved the way for Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>

    <p>France renewed its dominance of the high fashion (French: couture or haute couture) industry in the years
        1860–1960 through the establishing of the great couturier houses, the fashion press (Vogue was founded in 1892
        in US, and 1920 in France) and fashion shows. French fashion, particularly haute couture, became a fixture of
        France's post-war prestige-based commercial diplomacy, combining nation branding and export branding. The
        first modern Parisian couturier house is generally considered the work of the Englishman Charles Frederick
        Worth, who dominated the industry from 1858 to 1895. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century,
        the industry expanded through such Parisian fashion houses as the house of Jacques Doucet (founded in 1871),
        Rouff (founded 1884), Jeanne Paquin (founded in 1891), the Callot Soeurs (founded 1895 and operated by four
        sisters), Paul Poiret (founded in 1903), Louise Chéruit (founded 1906), Madeleine Vionnet (founded in 1912),
        House of Patou by Jean Patou (founded in 1919), Elsa Schiaparelli (founded in 1927) or Balenciaga (founded by
        the Spaniard Cristóbal Balenciaga in 1937).</p>
    <p>
        Chanel founded by Mademoiselle Coco Chanel, it first came to prominence in 1925, its philosophy was to
        emphasize understated elegance through her clothing. Her popularity thrived in the 1920s, because of innovative
        designs. Chanel's own look itself was as different and new as her creations. Instead of the usual pale-skinned,
        long-haired and full-bodied women preferred at the time, Chanel had a boyish figure, short cropped hair, and
        tanned skin. She had a distinct type of beauty that the world came to embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
        The horse culture and penchant for hunting so passionately pursued by the elites, especially the British, fired
        Chanel's imagination. Her own enthusiastic indulgence in the sporting life led to clothing designs informed by
        those activities. From her excursions on water with the yachting world, she appropriated the clothing associated
        with nautical pursuits: the horizontal striped shirt, bell-bottom pants, crewneck sweaters, and espadrille
        shoes—all traditionally worn by sailors and fishermen.

    <p>
        Many fashion houses closed during the occupation of Paris in World War II, including the Maison Vionnet and the
        Maison Chanel. In contrast to the stylish, liberated Parisienne, the Vichy regime promoted the model of the
        wife and mother, the robust, athletic young woman, a figure who was much more in line with the new political
        criteria. Germany, meanwhile, was taking possession of over half of what France produced, including high
        fashion, and was considering relocating French haute couture to the cities of Berlin and Vienna, neither of
        which had any significant tradition of fashion. The archives of the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture were
        seized, mostly for their client lists as Jews were excluded from the fashion industry at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
        During this era, the number of employed models was limited to seventy-five and designers often substituted
        materials in order to comply with wartime shortages. From 1940 onward, no more than thirteen feet (four meters)
        of cloth was permitted to be used for a coat and a little over three feet (one meter) for a blouse. No belt
        could be over one and a half inches (four centimeters) wide. As a result of the frugal wartime standards, the
        practical zazou suit became popular among young French men.
    </p>
    <p>
        In spite of the fact that so many fashion houses closed down or moved away during the war, several new houses
        remained open, including Jacques Fath, Maggy Rouff, Marcel Rochas, Jeanne Lafaurie, Nina Ricci, and Madeleine
        Vramant. During the Occupation, the only true way for a woman to flaunt her extravagance and add color to a
        drab outfit was to wear a hat. In this period, hats were often made of scraps of material that would have
        otherwise been thrown away, sometimes incorporating butter muslin, bits of paper, and wood shavings. Among the
        most innovative milliners of the time were Pauline Adam, Simone Naudet, Rose Valois, and Le Monnier.
    </p>
    <p>Post-war fashion returned to prominence through Christian Dior's famous "New Look" in 1947: the collection
        contained dresses with tiny waists, majestic busts, and full skirts swelling out beneath small bodices, in a
        manner very similar to the style of the Belle Époque. The extravagant use of fabric and the feminine elegance
        of the designs appealed greatly to a post-war clientele. Other important houses of the period included Pierre
        Balmain and Hubert de Givenchy (opened in 1952). The fashion magazine Elle was founded in 1945. In 1952, Coco
        Chanel herself returned to Paris.</p>

        In the 1960s, "high fashion" came under criticism from France's youth culture (including the yé-yés) who were
        turning increasingly to London and to casual styles. In 1966, the designer Yves Saint Laurent broke with
        established high fashion norms by launching a prêt-à-porter ("ready to wear") line and expanding French fashion
        into mass manufacturing and marketing (member houses of the Chambre Syndicale were forbidden to use even sewing
        machines). In 1985, Caroline Rennolds Milbank wrote, "The most consistently celebrated and influential
        designer of the past twenty-five years, Yves Saint Laurent can be credited with both spurring the couture's
        rise from its sixties ashes and with finally rendering ready-to-wear reputable." He is also credited with
        having introduced the tuxedo suit for women and was known for his use of non-European cultural references,
        and non-white models.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further innovations were carried out by Paco Rabanne and Pierre Cardin. In post-1968 France, youth culture
        would continue to gravitate away from the "sociopolitically suspect" luxury clothing industry, preferring
        instead a more "hippy" look (termed baba cool in French). With a greater focus on marketing and
        manufacturing, new trends were established by Sonia Rykiel, Thierry Mugler, Claude Montana, Jean-Paul Gaultier
        and Christian Lacroix in the 1970s and '80s. The 1990s saw a conglomeration of many French couture houses under
        luxury giants and multinationals such as LVMH.

        Fashion is so important to the French that, as The New York Times in 1995 quoted in an article on users of
        online dating services on Minitel, "Where else but in France would people describe themselves to potential
        partners in terms of their clothes?" Since the 1960s, France's fashion industry has come under increasing
        competition from London, New York, Milan and Tokyo. Nevertheless, many foreign designers still seek to make
        their careers in France: Karl Lagerfeld (German) at Chanel, John Galliano (British) and later, Raf Simons
        (Belgian) at Dior, Paulo Melim Andersson (Swedish) at Chloe, Stefano Pilati (Italian) at Yves Saint Laurent,
        Marc Jacobs (American) at Louis Vuitton, and Kenzo Takada (Japanese) and Alexander McQueen (English) at
        Givenchy (until 2001)
